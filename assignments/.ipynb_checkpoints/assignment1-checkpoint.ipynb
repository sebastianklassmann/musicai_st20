    "$\\rightarrow$ As your assignment is delivered via a private GitHub repository, you can work directly in the assignment notebook. Feel free to add as many markdown and code cells as you find neccessary!  \n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ Assignments will roughly follow the structure of the material used in the respective session. You can therefore use the headlines to quickly find any information you are looking for in the supplementary material.  \n",

    "$\\rightarrow$ Exercises that purely ask for information and do not include program code or pseudo-code obviously don't need commenting.  \n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ In the beginning sessions, the assignments will consist of a rather high number of rather simple exercises that often only require a single line of code. Therefore, please don't be scared by the length of these notebooks."
